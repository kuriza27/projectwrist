			<div id="dem-1" class="collapse">Unlike many of our competitors,
			RapidWristbands.com doesn’t have a minimum requirement for ordering and shipping wristbands. There is also
			no limitation on how many of each type of wristband must be ordered. Order as few as 1 wristband or as many
			as you need.</div>

			<div id="dem-2" class="collapse">The price of your order will depend on the
			quantity you choose. Our Order Now page features a handy calculator that updates the cost of your order as
			you choose the style and customization options for each type of wristband. The larger the quantity of your
			order, the lower the cost per wristband. Depending on the quantity, some wristbands can be as low as $0.06
			each! Visit our Price List for a breakdown of the cost of each type of wristband based on the quantity
			ordered. The more you order, the more you save.</div>

			message of up to 34 characters on the exterior of the band. Wristbands with 35 or more characters on
			the exterior will be charged an additional $0.03 per band. The interior message is debossed (engraved)
			in a simple text font that cannot be customized. Once the interior message's reaches 34 characters,
			there is a charge of $0.03 per band for a message up to 80 characters. The font size of a message may
			limit the amount of characters that will fit on the wristbands.</div>
